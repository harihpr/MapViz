# MapViz

A data visualization on a map that I worked on as a side project for a friend. The data file used for this project was proprietary, so it cannot be put here on github.

Libraries used:

jQuery - Javascript framework for frontend development

LeafletJS - Javascript library for mapping

D3JS - Javascript library for visualization

ChromaJS - Javascript library for colors in visualization

MarkerclusterJS - Leaflet plugin for clustering markers on a map

TopoJSON - A topology for maps
